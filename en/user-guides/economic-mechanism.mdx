### How Tumbuh Smart Rebalance Generates Yield

Tumbuh Smart Rebalance optimizes liquidity provisioning through two complementary models:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="1. Passive Market Making">
    Vaults deploy capital into AMMs such as **Morpho**, **Aerodrome**, and other concentrated liquidity markets. Strategies include:

    - Intelligent tick placement to maximize fee capture
    - Minimization of impermanent loss (IL)
    - Continuous optimization based on market volatility

    Key Characteristics:

    - Real-time rebalancing
    - Dynamic range management
    - Predictive analytics to adapt to changing volatility
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="2. Protocol-Managed Market Making">
    In protocol-managed strategies, vaults act on behalf of token issuers, stablecoin projects, or exchanges to maintain price efficiency. This includes:

    - Stablecoin anchor pairs (e.g., BTC/USDT, USDC/DAI)
    - IL-protected volatile pairs
    - Custom cooldown logic for strategic exits and slippage reduction

    These strategies aim to maintain market depth, reduce volatility, and drive consistent fee generation.

</AccordionGroup>

### Yield Composition

Vault APY is generated from three primary components:

- Fee Earnings From LP positions in concentrated liquidity markets.
- Spread Capture Earned through active market-making when prices move within deployed ranges.
- Utilization Premiums Additional yield derived from demand on specific vaults.

All returns flow back to the vault, increasing the Net Asset Value (NAV), which is benchmarked and updated regularly.

### Data Tracking & Reward Accounting

To ensure transparent and accurate yield calculations, Tumbuh tracks:

- All fee collection events within the DEX
- Swap activity occurring inside the vault's liquidity ranges
- Conversion of collected fees into IDRX using timestamp-aligned price feeds

This ensures rewards are consistently valued and normalized for user reporting.

### **Snapshot Data Structure**

Data is recorded at fixed intervals (every 10 minutes) and stored at the user level.\
Each snapshot contains the following fields:

| **Field**                           | **Description**                                                                                                      |
| :---------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **User's Fees Token A Amount**      | The total trading fees the user has earned in **Token A** within the liquidity pair.                                 |
| **User's Fees Token B Amount**      | The total trading fees the user has earned in **Token B**, the second asset in the liquidity pair.                   |
| **User's Rewards Token C Amount**   | Additional incentive rewards distributed in **Token C** (e.g., emissions from partner protocols).                    |
| **User's Rewards Token D Amount**   | Secondary incentive rewards distributed in **Token D**, if applicable.                                               |
| **User's New Rewards (USD)**        | The newly accumulated rewards since the previous snapshot, converted to **USD** using timestamp-aligned price feeds. |
| **User's Cumulative Rewards (USD)** | The user's **total lifetime earnings** up to this snapshot, also expressed in **USD**.                               |

This structured snapshot system ensures:

- **Transparent and verifiable** reward calculations
- **Accurate accounting** across multiple token types
- **Real-time insight** into both token-denominated and USD/IDRX-equivalent earnings
- **A consistent basis** for reporting, leaderboard ranking, and user dashboard updates

### Fees and Risks

| Performance Fee                         | Withdrawal Fee                      | Risks                                                                     |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Applied only when profits are realized. | None, unless specified by protocol. | Smart contract exploits, partner protocol failure, stablecoin depeg risk. |

  <Tab title="Fee Structure">
    **Tumbuh** use a transparent, performance-based fee model that aligns the interests of users, the protocol, and strategy providers. All fees are enforced on-chain and are clearly visible in the vault's dashboard.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Performance Fee">
    - **Rate:** 20% of realized gains above the High Water Mark (HWM), set individually per vault.
    - **Trigger:** Automatically charged during scheduled rebalancing events (every 1–2 days).
    - **High Water Mark Protection:**
      - Prevents fees on unrealized or historical profits.
      - New deposits raise the baseline to ensure users only pay on actual performance above their entry value.
    - **Destination:**
      - 100% of collected performance fees go to the Tumbuh protocol treasury.
      - Not shared with LPs or operators unless explicitly stated in future vault terms.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Management Fee">
    - **Current Rate:** 0%
    - **Status**: Disabled by default to maximize capital efficiency for depositors.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="User Protections & Exit Flexibility">
    - **No Lockups**: Funds can be withdrawn at any time (unless an emergency shutdown is triggered).
    - **No Withdrawal Fees**: Users are never charged fees for exiting the vault.
    - **Principal Protection via HWM:**
      - Depositors never subsidize past gains.
      - Fees only apply to new profits earned beyond their personal entry NAV.
