**Tumbuh** is an ERC-4626 compliant yield vault designed to unlock the full earning potential of IDRX holders by allocating assets into stablecoin based high yield DeFi protocols.

By converting a portion of deposited IDRX into USDC, USDT, or DAI, the vault ensures users gain access to more profitable APYs, all managed through auto rebalancing logic that dynamically shifts funds to the best performing protocols.

**_Stake IDRX, earn stablecoin yield, and grow your crypto passively. All in one vault._**

  <Tab title="The Problem We Solve">
    The Indonesian Rupiah (IDR) and its tokenized version (IDRX) face major hurdles in DeFi:

    - Limited protocols that support IDRX
    - Low or zero APY for IDRX-denominated strategies
    - Declining IDR-to-USD value reduces real yield
    - Manual asset conversion and allocation is risky & complex

    These problems make it hard for IDRX holders to earn meaningful returns or participate in global DeFi opportunities.

  <Tab title="Our Solution">
    Tumbuh solves these challenges through an automated yield vault:

    - Accepts IDRX deposits directly
    - Converts ~70% into stablecoins (USDC/USDT/DAI)
    - Allocates to protocols with the best APY
    - Auto-rebalances to maintain optimal yield
    - Users earn yield via ERC-4626 shares

    This creates a **seamless and passive experience** for users while unlocking broader yield opportunities through stablecoin strategies.
