 1. **Purpose**

    This Risk Disclosure (“Disclosure”) is issued by **Tumbuh** for the purpose of informing users of the risks associated with accessing, interacting with, or transacting through the **Tumbuh Protocol** (“Protocol”), including but not limited to the website located at [_tumbuh.fi_](http://tumbuh.fi), any interfaces facilitating access to the Protocol, and any vaults, applications, or derivative products developed by Tumbuh or third parties using or incorporating any component of the Protocol (collectively, the “Products”).

    This Disclosure sets forth material risks inherent in decentralized finance (“DeFi”) systems and outlines user responsibilities when interacting with the Protocol.
 2. **Scope**

    This Disclosure applies to all interactions with the Protocol, including but not limited to:\
    (a) execution of smart contract transactions;\
    (b) participation in governance (if applicable);\
    (c) use of all associated interfaces, services, or tools; and\
    (d) interaction with any third-party systems, vaults, or applications integrating the Protocol.

    By accessing the Protocol, the user acknowledges and agrees to the terms of this Disclosure.
 3. **General Statement**

    The Protocol constitutes an experimental, permissionless, and decentralized technology system.\
    By using the Protocol, the user acknowledges that:
    - DeFi technologies are inherently experimental and may not function as intended;
    - The user bears sole responsibility for understanding the risks associated with such technologies; and
    - The user assumes all risk of loss arising from use of the Protocol.

    Tumbuh shall not, under any circumstances, be held liable for losses or damages arising from the user’s interaction with the Protocol.
 4. **Experimental Nature of the Technology**

    The Protocol, including but not limited to its smart contracts, vaults, software components, and any associated blockchain interactions, is experimental in nature.\
    The Protocol is provided **“as is,” “as available,” and without warranties of any kind**, whether express or implied, including warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, or non-infringement.

    Use of the Protocol may result in unforeseen outcomes, including irreversible loss of digital assets.
 5. **General Risks**

    **5.1 Market Volatility**

    Digital asset markets are volatile. Asset values may fluctuate significantly, and such volatility may impair the value or usability of digital assets engaged with the Protocol.

    **5.2 Regulatory and Legal Risk**

    The regulatory environment for DeFi is uncertain. Regulatory developments, enforcement actions, or changes in applicable law may adversely affect the user’s ability to access or utilize the Protocol. Users bear full responsibility for ensuring compliance with all applicable laws.
 6. **Security Risks**

    **6.1 Cybersecurity Threats**

    Use of the Protocol may expose users to cybersecurity risks including phishing, malware, denial-of-service attacks, exploitation of unknown vulnerabilities, and other malicious acts. Tumbuh does not guarantee resistance to such threats.

    **6.2 Smart Contract Vulnerabilities**

    Smart contracts may contain defects, bugs, or vulnerabilities—whether known or undiscovered—that could be exploited to cause loss, theft, or impairment of assets.

    **6.3 Advanced Persistent Threats**

    Highly sophisticated actors, including state-sponsored entities, may target the Protocol.

    **6.4 Technological Unknowns**

    Future technological developments (e.g., advancements in cryptography or quantum computing) may compromise the security assumptions underlying blockchain systems.
 7. **Technical Risks**

    **7.1 Software Failures**

    The Protocol relies on complex software that may malfunction or behave unpredictably.

    **7.2 Architectural or Logical Flaws**

    Errors or flaws in technical design or implementation may cause unintended operations, including loss of assets.
 8. **Protocol-Specific Risks**

    **8.1 Smart Contract Execution Risk**

    Execution of transactions on the Protocol may not occur as intended due to smart contract logic, network conditions, or user error.

    **8.2 Liquidation Risk (If Applicable)**

    Certain vaults or strategies may include collateral requirements or liquidation mechanisms. Failure to maintain sufficient collateral or monitor position health may result in irreversible liquidation.

    **8.3 Service Availability**

    Tumbuh does not guarantee uninterrupted, error-free, or timely operation of the Protocol.
 9. **Third-Party Risks**

    **9.1 Reliance on Oracles and External Services**

    The Protocol may rely on external services, including price oracles, data feeds, RPC nodes, or third-party smart contracts.\
    Failures, delays, manipulations, or inaccuracies in these systems may adversely affect Protocol behavior.

    **9.2 Third-Party Dependencies**

    Certain functionalities may depend on timely or correct actions by third parties.\
    Tumbuh assumes no responsibility for failures arising from third-party actions or omissions.
10. **Open-Source and Experimental Components**

    The Protocol incorporates open-source and experimental technologies.\
    Such technologies may contain defects, lack maintenance guarantees, or interact unpredictably with other systems.
11. **User Responsibilities**

    **11.1 Legal Compliance**

    Users are solely responsible for compliance with all applicable laws, including taxation, anti-money laundering (AML), counter-terrorist financing (CTF), and sanctions regulations.

    **11.2 Custody and Security**

    Users bear full responsibility for safeguarding private keys, seed phrases, wallet credentials, and access devices.\
    Tumbuh cannot restore or reverse lost access credentials.

    **11.3 Transaction Accountability**

    Blockchain transactions are final and irreversible. Users are responsible for verifying transaction details before submission.

    **11.4 Operational Security**

    Users must maintain appropriate security practices to protect their digital assets.

    **11.5 Due Diligence**

    Users should conduct independent research and seek professional advice where appropriate.
12. **Legal Uncertainty**

    Changes in law, emerging regulations, or enforcement actions may restrict, modify, or prohibit access to the Protocol.\
    Users bear responsibility for monitoring applicable legal obligations.
13. **No Professional Advice**

    Information provided by Tumbuh is for informational purposes only and does not constitute investment, financial, legal, or professional advice.\
    Users must not rely on such information when making financial decisions.
14. **No Fiduciary Duties**

    Tumbuh does not act as a fiduciary to any user.\
    By using the Protocol, users acknowledge that no fiduciary duties are owed, and users bear sole responsibility for their financial decisions.
15. **Assumption of Risk and Limitation of Liability**

    By accessing the Protocol, the user expressly acknowledges and accepts all risks described herein.\
    To the fullest extent permitted by law, Tumbuh disclaims liability for any losses or damages arising from:
    - Use or misuse of the Protocol
    - Security breaches or vulnerabilities
    - Regulatory actions
    - Service interruptions
    - Third-party failures
    - Market volatility

    Users agree to indemnify and hold Tumbuh harmless from any claims relating to their use of the Protocol.
16. **Incident Reporting and Transparency**

    Tumbuh seeks to provide transparency in the event of security incidents or material failures.\
    Tumbuh may, but is not obligated to, disclose incidents publicly.\
    Such disclosures do not create liability for resulting losses.
17. **Mitigation Measures**

    Tumbuh employs industry-standard security practices, including independent third-party audits.\
    However, such measures do not eliminate all risks.
18. **User Acknowledgment**

By interacting with the **Tumbuh Protocol**, the user confirms that they:

1. Have read and understood this Risk Disclosure;
2. Accept and assume all associated risks;
3. Acknowledge that Tumbuh is not liable for any direct or indirect losses; and
4. Agree to be bound by the terms herein.
