title: "Privacy Policy"

At **Tumbuh**, your privacy and security are our top priorities.\
This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you interact with our website, application, and any related services (collectively referred to as the **“Platform”**).

1. **Information We Collect**

   Tumbuh is a **non-custodial, wallet-based DeFi platform**, which means:
   - We **do not collect, store, or manage personal information** such as names, addresses, emails, or identification numbers.
   - Your wallet remains under your full control at all times. **Tumbuh never accesses or stores your private keys**, seed phrases, or custodial credentials.

   However, to operate the Platform and improve user experience, we may collect the following types of information: 2. **Public Blockchain Data**
   - Wallet addresses
   - On-chain transaction activity
   - Token balances

   This information is inherently public and accessible on the blockchain. 3. **Technical & Usage Data**
   - Browser type, device model, operating system
   - Language settings
   - Referring URLs and session analytics
   - Time spent interacting with the Platform’s interface
   4. **Cookies & Analytics**

      We may use cookies or similar technologies to analyze aggregated usage patterns and improve Platform performance.
4. **How We Use the Information**

   Any information collected is used strictly for the following purposes:
   - Enhancing user experience and improving Platform functionality
   - Monitoring service integrity and detecting suspicious or malicious activities
   - Providing updates, feature announcements, or campaign notifications (only if you opt-in)

   Tumbuh **does not sell, rent, share, or trade your data** with third parties for advertising or marketing purposes.
4. **Third-Party Services**

   Tumbuh may use third-party tools or infrastructure providers (e.g., analytics platforms, RPC providers, indexing services) to support Platform functionality.

   These third parties may include, but are not limited to:
   - Web analytics providers
   - RPC and node operators
   - Indexing protocols
   - Cloud infrastructure providers

   Each external service maintains its own privacy policies.\
   Tumbuh is **not responsible** for how third-party platforms handle or protect data once it is processed by them.
4. **Data Security**

   We implement industry-standard measures to protect Platform integrity and the data we handle. However:
   - **Blockchain data is public by design** and permanently recorded on-chain.
   - Users are solely responsible for securing their **wallets, devices, seed phrases, and private keys**.
   - Tumbuh cannot recover lost wallets or reverse blockchain transactions.
2. **User Control & Rights**

   Because Tumbuh does not store personally identifiable information, users maintain full control through their connected wallets.

   You may disconnect or stop using Tumbuh at any time.\
   To revoke permissions, simply remove access within your wallet or browser extension.
3. **Updates to This Policy**

   This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically to reflect product enhancements, operational changes, or evolving compliance requirements.\
   Any modifications will be posted on this page.\
   Continued use of the Platform constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
