#### Vault Provider Risks 

- DEX Dependency: Mitigated by due diligence, live monitoring, and emergency withdrawal plans
- Oracle Failures: Multi-oracle setup with fallback protocols
- Fee Logic Errors: Individual HWM tracking, audit trails, refund safeguards

#### Data Provider Risks 

- Quality & Availability: Multi-source validation, real-time backups, provider SLAs
- Security: Access controls, anomaly detection, incident response protocols

#### Strategy Curator Risks 

- Pool Selection: Enforced criteria for liquidity, volume, and volatility
- Backtest Bias: Out-of-sample testing, Monte Carlo sims, live paper trading
- Capacity Saturation: Modeled thresholds, staged capital, multi-pool diversification

#### Guardian Oversight 

- Performance Drift: Monitors deviation vs model, triggers recalibration
- Monitoring Gaps: Redundant systems with health checks
- Slow Response: Clear incident escalation paths and role-based response drills
