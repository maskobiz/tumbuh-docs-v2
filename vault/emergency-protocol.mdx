#### Monitoring

Automated (every 30–60s):

- PnL losses, slippage, gas spikes, TVL drops → auto actions manual (daily).
- Guardian checks performance, IL, volatility, data status

### Response Workflow

- System triggers: Auto-reduce positions or initiate shutdown
- Manual review: Vault Provider & Curator decide on adjustments
- Execution: Actions taken or overridden within 60 minutes
- User communication: Updates every 10–60 minutes with full report in 24h

### Recovery

Post-emergency audits, parameter updates, and enhanced monitoring for 7 days.

By assigning risks to roles and defining safeguards at each layer, Tumbuh ensures vault reliability, transparency, and user protection in live DeFi environments.
